In this project it is attempted to develop a general server framework that developers can utilize when creating multi-player games. The goal is to be flexible enough that the framework can be used to support a wide array of games, but still provide required functionality to save developers the time of developing game specific frameworks themselves. To help demonstrate the developed solution, an Android application is developed simultaneously, utilizing the server functionality. At the end of the project, both the framework and application are functional, but not complete. The server framework has been tested in stability and load, and was found to be reliable. The developed solution has however ended up being less separated than desired, supporting the Android application a little too specific.
