\section{Flow Control}
When different machines with different network speeds communicate, it is important to ensure that the machine on the receiving end of the TCP connection is not overwhelmed. If the receiver is overwhelmed it may not be able to receive and process the data it receives reliably. TCP uses a flow control protocol to avoid this. It is done by allowing the receiver to specify how much additional data it is willing to buffer for the current TCP connection. The sender can then only send as much data as the receiver specified, until it receives an acknowledgement and an updated buffer value from the receiver.\\
