\chapter{From Idea to Framework}

This chapter describes the general methodology behind the entire project. It will describe the overlying architecture. It will furthermore describe how and why we have taken the approach we have taken and describe advantages and disadvantages to the approach. 

We have chosen to develop a game and the framework simultaneously. The idea behind this work method is to ensure the framework entails all the methods and functionality needed to create a game. Furthermore it was developed to validate the project is good enough to create a detailed game without being specifically programmed for it.
