\chapter{From Idea to Framework}

This chapter describes the general methodology behind the project. It will describe the underlying architecture. It will furthermore describe how and why we have taken the approach we have, and describe advantages and disadvantages to it.

We have chosen to develop the framework simultaneously with a game based on the functionality provided by it. The idea behind this work method is to ensure the framework entails all the requirements needed to create a game. Furthermore it was developed to validate the framework is good enough to create a detailed game without being specifically programmed for it.
