\section{Scenario 1: Maps \& Navigation - City areas}
In a large city, e.g. one of the 5 largest cities in Denmark, data connectivity can be obscured by many big buildings or concrete parking garage. This type of data connection loss can be unpredictable and happen in an instant. A scenario can be a travelling salesman arriving at an unknown large city trying to find a customer on a navigation system. The salesman is limited on time and relying completely on the navigation system to find him the customer. The salesman will rely on a system that can detect which buildings will cause connection loss and hereby download maps and navigation in time.
