% It introduces the problem and motivation for the study.
When in an unknown area, it can be useful to have information about the area around you. Information such as map data for navigation or other information about one's surroundings. Not all areas are equally well covered in regards to mobile data networks, such as 3G or 4G. A plausible scenario could be that one is entering an area with bad or no coverage. In this case it would be a good idea to have maps available. This, however, requires a user's smartphone to be aware of coverage drops and coverage blackouts. This way the device can cache relevant data e.g. a map to be used for navigation.
