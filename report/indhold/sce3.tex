\section{Scenario 3 Bus and Train}
In this scenario the problem be solved is to minimize Internet dropouts when traveling on frequently used bus or train lines. The idea is to collect data on a user basic and use that data to identify areas where the user might lose connection.

The solution should be able to detect traveling by bus or train and predict the route and destination. It should reduce the user experience of no Internet doing the travel and make relevant information available for the destination should it be in a poorly connected area.
