\section{Scenario 3 - Bus and Train}
In this scenario the problem be solved is to minimize Internet drop-outs when travelling on frequently used bus or train lines. The idea is to collect data on a user base and use that data to identify areas where the user might lose connection.

The solution should be able to detect travelling by bus or train and predict the route and destination. It should reduce the user experience of no Internet during the travel and make relevant information available for the destination, should it be in a poorly connected area.
