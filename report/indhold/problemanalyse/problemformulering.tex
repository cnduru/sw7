\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:probstate}
When creating games the amount of time and funds spent are valuable resource. To ensure a high amount of quality code, the developer has to spent a lot of time writing trivial code and it will thrive the cost up. This naturally raises the question:

\fxfatal{Kan det sk√¶rpes og generaliseres? - Ivan Aaen 2014 - 9/12}
The idea is simple, we want to creating framework for creating simple coordinate-based multiplayer shooter games. In order for the problem statement to be fulfilled, we raised some additional goals to the question asked above:

\begin{itemize}
\item The framework has to be as flexible as possible.
\item The framework has to account for multiple instances of games with multiple users.
\item The framework has to be easy to use. 
\end{itemize}


%Scenarios

%\input{indhold/sce2}
%\input{indhold/sce3}

%In order to do so several approaches are available.

%A simple approach is to measure the signal strength of the device and use that as the base for predicting when connection will be unavailable. Using this method a stable but slowly dropping signal strength might indicate a future with no connection available, in this event the required web resources should be cached so they are available doing an offline period. Another scenario could when the signal is unstable but the average remains high, this could indicate interference in the area but no risk of a significant offline period, in this case caching is not necessary.

%Another approach is to base the prediction on historical data of the near area. This can be done by gathering data of where Internet connections usually drops and build a map for the available providers. Then the caching will be done when a device is predicted to move into such an area.

%Problem statement
% How can a user be guaranteed to always have relevant information available, regardless of network connectivity?
