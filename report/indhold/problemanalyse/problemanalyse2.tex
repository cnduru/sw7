%  - What is gained from solving it?
Development of an online multiplayer game serving many users can be split into two parts: Creating the game, and creating the underlying architecture. The focus of this project is on creating a flexible and reliable server architecture \fxfatal{client-server? smth else?} allowing easy development of multiplayer games for Android smartphones. The aim is to make it possible for developers to focus on the game development without having to worry about managing the underlying architecture. 

A problem with developing different games from scratch as opposed to having a standardized framework is the compatibility. Having different types of devices with different versions of various operating systems means that some devices might not be compatible with the desired program. What this means is that programs act differently on different devices because of the inconsistent code - and for this to be a non issue you would have to create code to match each type of device and operating system which is an extreme task. Having a framework that is already compatible with the different devices allows the coder to focus solely on the game.

%% Potential problems
%  Server related:
%  - Network connection
%  - Efficient communication
%  - Many users
%  - GPS, latency (actions close to each other?)

%  Non server related:
%  - Attracting users
%  - Keeping users
%  - Earning money
%  - Similar applications to learn from
