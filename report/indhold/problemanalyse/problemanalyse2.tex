\chapter{Problem Analysis}

%% Problem
%  Define the problem in terms of:

%  - Problem area / General problem
%  - People affected
%  - Problem results in...
%  - What is gained from solving it?
Development of an online multiplayer game serving many users can roughly be split into two parts: Creating the game, and creating the underlying architecture. The focus of this project is on creating a flexible and reliable server architecture \fxfatal{client-server? smth else?} allowing easy development of location-based games for Android smartphones. The aim is to make it possible for developers to focus on the game development without having to worry about managing the underlying archetechture. \fxfatal{Jeg lukker bare vand ud af Ã¸rerne.. skal nok omskrives et par gange...}




%% Potential problems
%  Server related:
%  - Network connection

%  - GPS, latency (actions close to each other?)

%  Non server related:
%  - Attracting users
%  - Keeping users
%  - Earning money
%  - Similar applications to learn from
