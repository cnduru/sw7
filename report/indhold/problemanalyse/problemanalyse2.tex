Development of an online multiplayer game serving many users can roughly be split into two parts: Creating the game, and creating the underlying architecture. The focus of this project is on creating a flexible and reliable server architecture \fxfatal{client-server? smth else?} allowing easy development of multiplayer games for Android smartphones. The aim is to make it possible for developers to focus on the game development without having to worry about managing the underlying architecture. 

The main problem for new game developers is the issue of having to creating  good usable framework for their specific needs. At the start of a project, game developers set out to create a framework that can handle all of the functions that the game need, without really having specified precisely how those functions are implemented. This means that if functions change or something entirely new comes up, the framework have to be adjusted to the specific need. An example of this could be how the game handles several users, maybe the game have different needs depending on some variating variable. The amount of workload a developer has to put into creating the framework to match exactly his demand is greatly increased. The different requirements and often change in the framework often gives an everlastingness to the code.

It requires a lot more work and overview from the small game developers to keep the framework completely up to date. Bigger firms almost always require multiple sections to use the same framework - and therefor consistency is a must. More often than not these firms create their own frameworks to design them exactly the way they need it, but smaller firms might have limited funds. This means that smaller developers often either skip on creating features they normally would or create sloppy and inefficient code.

Creating a joint framework that could be used by different could save smaller and new game developers a lot of time, and create a standard that makes coding on top of it easy. \fxfatal{Dette er en start p√• problem analyse - der kan sagtens addes mere omkring potentielle problemer og non server related issues}




%% Potential problems
