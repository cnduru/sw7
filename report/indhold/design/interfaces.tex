\section{Interfaces}
%INTRO:
%Server and client both consist of several small parts that all need to communicate.
%Examples: user->client, client->server, game->db...

%PROJECT IMPACT:
%Several sub-groups are developing the different parts, so...
%How does this need for communication impact development?

%We chose to do *like this* - why did we choose that, and was it a good choice, or would something else have been better?

%SOLUTION
%How is this communication done? (How are the interfaces made, and how was it decided?)

%Why is it done like this? Is it efficient? Easy? Scalable? Maintainable? Something else?

%Are there any alternatives? Why not one of them?
