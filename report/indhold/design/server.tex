\section{Server Architecture}
%The purpose of this section is to describe the overall architecture of the server.

% Something like:

%		Client
%		------
%Server:  IO
%       [] [] [] [] []...
%     [Game1] [Game 2] ... [Game n]   [MENU/LOGIN]
%     []  []  []  [] []...
%        [DB]

% Class diagram

% Database schema

\subsection{Database}
The database is designed with flexibility in mind which means it is up the game logic to interpret the data in the database. \figref{fig:ER}\fxwarning{export new ER diagram} shows the entity relation diagram for the database without attributes. The database is structured as follows:

\end{figure}




\paragraph{Account}
The Account entity represent the users in the system. An account can host games represented by the host relation and take part in games represented as owning a player in a particular game.

\paragraph{Player}
This entity represent a user playing in a game. A player can hold items, have status effects and be a member of a team represented by Inventory, has(Status Effect) and Team(is\_member) respectively. The player entity also contains score and location etc. for a particular player in a game.

\paragraph{Game}
This entity represent games either \textit{starting up}, \textit{in progress} and \textit{ended}.

\paragraph{Status Effect}
Effects on a player is represented by this entity. An effect could be \textit{disabled until time} on a particular player. Status Effects have an effect type which the game logic is responsible for defining.

\paragraph{Team}
Players can be members of teams in a game, though a player is not required to be on a team to allow free for all game modes.


\paragraph{Item}
Items represent any object in the inventory of players or on a location in the game world. Items can be anything from objects players can ``pick up'' to a capturable area in the game world. The attributes and behavior of items are defined by game logic.

\paragraph{Location}
A location is an item in the game world can belong to a team or no teams.
