\subsection{Noget server.}
This section will contains possible improvements upon the current implementation. Some general improvements such as more are 

\subsubsection{Multi Threading}
In our implementation of the framework we have used threads and this has lead to a some unresolved issues. An example of this is in the dispatcher, see \Cref{sec:dispImplementation}, where threads gives problems when creating or closing games. This could be solved by restricting access to \texttt{GameThreadPool} which is currently shared amount all worker threads.

Another issue is that there is no set limit how many games can run at the same time. Eventually exceptions will be thrown when continuing to generate game threads.


\subsubsection{Blurriness Between Client and Sever}
In the implementation of the game not all method where implemented generically. An example is the callable method \texttt{Shoot} and the class weapon. Methods like \texttt{Shoot} should have been implemented with a \texttt{UseItem} call according to our design.

\subsubsection{Error Handling}
Error handling is sparse in some areas 

\subsubsection{Trusty Server}
everything the client sends is legal
