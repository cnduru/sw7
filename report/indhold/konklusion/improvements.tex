\section{Improvements}

In its current state, the project is functional but not fully implemented for optimal use. The framework lacks functionality because the focus has been on creating different features rather than writing trivial implementations of similar concepts. Rather than implementing a broad spectrum of similar functionality the focus was set on creating depth with what was specifically needed for the game we have created. This results in the separation between game and framework becoming eerie, and the framework ends up overlapping with the game.

We have described several possible improvements of both the server and client, in the sections ahead.
