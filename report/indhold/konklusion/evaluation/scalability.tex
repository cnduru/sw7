\subsection{Scalability}
To allow one server to host as many games as possible, we set a goal to make the framework as scalable as possible. By scalable we mean allowing many games, each with many users, to use the server at the same time. In \Cref{sec:test} we tested the response time when the server was under load by many concurrent games and when it was only received few requests.
The tests showed that if many games busy games are running at the same time, the response time often exceeds the 0.5 seconds that is desired. It is, however, difficult to set a specific number, as that requires us to know exactly how many requests a game would produce in a real setting.
Overall, the framework allows hosting a decent amount of games on a single server, and while the implementation can likely be improved, e.g. by using a more efficient mean of communication than XML, it is also possible to distribute the game threads on multiple servers, having one server dedicated only to dispatching. That would allow hosting more games by adding more servers, letting the games scale to accomodate many more users.
