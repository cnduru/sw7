% It outlines the purpose and specific objectives of the project.
Development of an online multiplayer game serving many users can be split into two parts: Creating the actual game functionality, and creating the underlying architecture to support it. When developing new games these parts are possibly mixed together as the underlying architecture is only used for the specific game. This has the consequence that the developer possibly writes a game specific architecture, and not a general architecture. In some cases, the developer may want to create other similar games with the same underlying structure, but since the architecture and the game itself are intertwined, it is difficult to reuse the same structure. The developer would have to first search through the previous model and extract the desired features, which costs some time. Furthermore, the functionality might not be an exact match to the needs of the new game, requiring additional time to adjust the code.

The focus of this project is to create a flexible and reliable architecture for a server that supports client based multiplayer games. The goal is to allow easy development of multiplayer games for smartphones, and to make it possible for developers to focus on the game development without having to worry about managing the underlying architecture.

The framework will focus on creating a platform for games centered around the location of the player. It has to be scalable, and therefore the server should easily be able to handle multiple games and multiple devices (players) at the same time. This means it is a requirement that multiple clients should be able to connect to the server and perform different actions at the same time. The framework should be able to handle GPS-coordinates, using it as the base of some sort of action, depending on the game implementation of the game, e.g. in a shooter game you are able to shoot players within a certain distance. 

Creating new games from scratch requires both time and monetary investments. While some companies might have these resources available, it could increase the potential profit if some of these resources could be saved. The extra time either means a bigger profit for the developer or more time to work on game features. We argue that creating a flexible framework could help improve this situation.

A framework serves as a basic set of functionality and structural guidelines for the game to be built upon. Overall, game development rarely fits traditional software development process such as the waterfall method, as requirements can change quickly\fixme{source?}. Fairly, an agile development process is often used \cite{Gamedevelopment}. The result is that functionality might have to change on a frequent basis. Whether this means new functionality or rewriting already existing functions - a game with an intertwined framework and game will take more time to rewrite, as components often have or provide dependencies for other parts.\\

Consider a third person shooter game where functionality revolves around specific gun types and their functionalities. Far into the development, another gun type might be a new requirement. The developer would, depending on the existing framework have to rewrite much of the code regarding guns in general to suddenly include new functionality. This requires a lot of extra time compared to having a framework that allows easy addition and removal of gun functionality. Worse is examples where you have to abandon an idea and create something entirely different. Having to rewrite all the code would be tedious, especially when it involves the framework. Having an independent framework could help alleviate this issue.

The size and the amount of divisions of a developing company also matters. The more different people working on it, the more precision is needed both in the documentation and the framework. Having multiple people writing code on the same game requires the underlying architecture to be as consistent as possible. Changing something in the framework or the underlying architecture requires a notification to all different divisions and people working on the game. It might result in some code refactoring \cite{Gameprod}. These companies often create their own framework and document it through the game design document \cite{Gamedesign} in order for it to fit exactly their needs. This causes them to have a consistent and steady framework to work on, and work individually without consulting different divisions. Smaller developer companies might not have the luxury of creating a completely game specific framework for each of their projects. This results in smaller developer companies often having to spend more work hours adjusting their code to what their co-developers have coded.

Another problem with developing different games from scratch as opposed to having a standardized framework is compatibility. Having different types of devices with different versions of various operating systems means that some devices might not be compatible with the program. What this means is that programs act differently on different devices. With an existing framework this only has to be implemented once. Having a framework that is already compatible with the different devices allows the coder to focus solely on the game, and therefore limiting the amount of time needed for creating portable code.

Constructing a framework that could be used by different developers could save the developer a lot of time and money, if the developer uses the framework as intended. It could and should be easier to use for the developer - giving him less work hours needed to create the same content he otherwise would. The struggle with creating a framework like this is that it has to be flexible enough for game developers to create diverse games, but still be precise enough for the developers to not have to write an a lot of code, in order to fit it to the game.

The goal is widely pursued in the form of game engines and general APIs. A large amount of games being developed, are developed on top of already existing game engines. An example of a game engine is the `Adventure Game Studio', providing an API for creating games in third person perspective along with support for pre-rendering. The developer, Chris Jones, has created different functionality he deemed important for creating these games and published it in the form of a simple IDE for game developers \cite{adv-game}. It is specific in the way it focuses on third person adventure games, making specific functionality.
Another example of game engines, is full blown engines with multiple purposes for a specific genre. One of the most used engines for first person shooters is the "Unreal Engine" which is used for many major shooter or fighter games. It is used both as a visual aid, providing 3D rendering but also provides pre-rendering functionality.
