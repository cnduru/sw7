\section{Error Detection}
The TCP protocol makes error detection possible. Each packet is assigned a sequence number which enables receivers to ignore duplicate packets and sequence packets which have been reordered, in the right sequence. \fixme{fra wiki: Acknowledgments allow senders to determine when to retransmit lost packets.????????}. To ensure correctness of the packet content, each packet has a checksum included which the packet's content can be compared to upon arrival at its destination.\\

This possibility of error checking comes in handy in our project. When a map is transmitted to a client, it ensures that the map data is not corrupted. This is very desirable since corrupted map data could make the map unusable in the best case, and show wrong map data in the worst case.
