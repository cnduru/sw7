\chapter{The Framework}

This chapter describes all of the choices considered for the framework. It will describe how the game influenced the server and framework, and advantages and disadvantages of this. The chapter focuses on the separation of the framework and the game - it will describe the relationship between different game functions and their framework counterpart. It will also describe the implementation of the said features and the possible uses of it. In the end, the test andits results will be described.

\section{Design}\label{sec:desFram}
With the prototyping described in \Cref{sec:game} we can design a server architecture to accommodate the described features. In this section we will first describe the overall architecture and then look at the individual components.

\section{Implementation}
The implementation of the server is described in this section. The section contains implementation details of the Dispatcher, Logic Layer and Data Layer.\\

The implementation is based on the choices made in \Cref{sec:desFram} where the framework design is described.
