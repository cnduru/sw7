\chapter{The Framework}

This chapter describes all of the choices considered for the framework. It will describe how the game influenced the server and framework and advantages and disadvantages of this. The chapter focuses on the separation of the framework and the game - it will describe the relationship between different game functions and their framework counterpart. It will describe the implementation of the said features and the possible uses of it. In the end, the test and the result of it will be described.

\section{Design}
With the prototyping of \Cref{sec:game} we can design a server architecture to accommodate the described features. In this section we will first describe the overall architecture and then look at the individual components.
