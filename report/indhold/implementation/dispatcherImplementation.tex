\chapter{Implementation of Dispatcher}
\label{chap:dispImplementation}
The dispatcher is a central component in the framework. It is sectioned into two parts, one part that handles XML data containing login information and one that handles other XML data. As the name implies, the dispatcher simply dispatches a call to the appropriate method with the appropriate parameters when it receives XML data. In order to do this, it also deserializes the XML to extract data to pass on to the appropriate methods. Each of the methods that can then be called know how to handle the specific data they are sent. After the dispatcher has dispatched a call, it receives an XML string from the method it called containing data to be used by the client. The dispatcher then returns that string and it is sent to the client.
