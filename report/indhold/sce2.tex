\section{Scenario 2: Maps \& Navigation - Outside Cities}
In some cases it is possible to lose ones data connection for an extended period of time. This could happen when entering a relatively big zone without coverage. A scenario could be a couple taking a long walk in a forest, exploring different paths. Given bad signal strength in the area, the trees obstruct what little signal they could have received. They would have wanted a map of the area, so they had an idea where the different paths led, but did not consider there would be no connection.

The solution should in this scenario had been able to detect that a loss of connection would happen soon after entering the forest. It should then have downloaded the map preemptively along with relevant point of interests. The couple would then be able to keep track of the paths without having to worry about losing the signal.
