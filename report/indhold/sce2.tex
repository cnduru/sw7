\section{Scenario 2: Maps \& Navigation - Countryside Areas}
When travelling out of cities, data connectivity can be unavailable for a longer period of time. This type of data connection loss is slowly fading away as you move further away from the connection source.

A scenario can be a couple going for a walk in the woods on the countryside. They are visiting an unknown area and walks into the woods. They happen to get lost and wants to find their way back to the car, but in the woods no data connection is available and they are lost.

A modification of this scenario could be a couple that wants to get additional knowledge of the area they are walking around in, e.g. visiting Rold skov in Denmark, they might want to read the stories about the robbers from Rold. It is also possible that they want to know about the attractions in the area, and directions to them.

The challenges are predicting that the data connection will be lost in the near future, and what services should be attempted to download to a mobile device.
