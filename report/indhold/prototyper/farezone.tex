\section{Dangerzone based on analysis}
\label{sec:dgrzone}

The thought behind this idea is simple and easy to implement given we have the information needed to do the analysis. The idea is to design a heat map based on some sort of information - in this example we will be using location of radio towers and  the location of forests. Whenever two signals overlap the ``heat'' would rise in that section as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:tempdgr_1}. In our example forests obstruct signal, therefore creating less signal on the opposing side of the forest, this is illustrated in \ref{fig:tempdgr_2}. With these implications we can build the entire map based on information gathered before the application is launched.

A map designed on different possible aspects (e.g. placement of towers, infrastructure) and not on data collected.
