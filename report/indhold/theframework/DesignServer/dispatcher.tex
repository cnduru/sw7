\subsubsection{Dispatcher}\label{subsec:dispatcherdesign}
The Dispatcher is a central component in the framework. It is placed in the \textit{Dispatcher Service} in the architecture, and is the first to interpret a request sent by a client. The dispatcher simply dispatches a call to the appropriate method with the appropriate parameters when it receives XML data. In order to do this, it reads the root tag of the XML to extract information to decide the appropriate destination and the right method to call. It attaches the XML as parameter to the method call.

The Dispatcher looks for the specified method call in the XML to hand it over to the Admin module. This is static calling of methods with attached XML. The Dispatcher waits for the Admin to return an XML, which it returns to the Async IO.

The Dispatcher handles all requests to a game thread dynamically, as it only extracts the name of the correct method call before handing it over to the game thread. It then waits until the game thread returns an XML response string, which it returns to the Async IO.
