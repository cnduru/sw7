\subsubsection{Asynchronous I/O}
\label{sec:asyncImplementation}
The implementation of the asynchronous I/O is based on Microsoft's ``Asynchronous Server Socket Example'' \cite{asynh-imlp}. The implementation consists of a few methods to handle asynchronous I/O, these are \texttt{StartListening}, \texttt{AcceptCallback}, \texttt{ReadCallback} and \texttt{Send}. \texttt{StartListening} is responsible for listening for socket connections and when a connection is established an \texttt{AsyncCallback} (part of the .NET threading library) is made with \texttt{AcceptCallback} to process the incoming data. \texttt{AcceptCallback} prepares for receiving data then calls \texttt{ReadCallback}. \texttt{ReadCallback} reads data from the socket until an end of file tag is read at which point the data is parsed on to the dispatcher. Finally, \texttt{Send} is used to send the result of the request back to the client. %http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fx6588te%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
