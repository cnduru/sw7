\section{Implementation of XML handler}
\label{sec:xmlhandlerimpl}
To handle incoming requests from clients, a component was needed to read and translate the XML formatted strings that communication is based on. This resulted in the \textit{XMLhandler} class. The class has many methods, but is simple to use. Given any valid string of XML, the method \textit{GetMethodCallFromXML} will extract what type of request is contained within the XML. This is returned as a string. The remaining methods are desgined to handle all individual requests. Given that the type of request is now known, the relevant method can now be used to decode and convert values stored within the XML string into readable formats.

An example would be an XML string containing a login attempt. Using \textit{GetMethodCallFromXML} will extract that the request is of the type \textit{Login}. The method \textit{GetLoginData} can then be used to extract the contained username and password as two individual strings.
