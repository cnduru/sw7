\subsubsection{Admin}
\label{sec:adminimpl}
The \texttt{Admin} class handles requests from the client that can be classified as non game specific. These are requests like:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{VerifiyAccount} handles login-requests from the client.
\item \textit{CreateGame} handles requests to create and start a new game.
\end{itemize}

The Admin will handle these requests by querying the database through the Data Layer, more specifically the \texttt{DBController} class. The database will then return the desired data that can be used for something like administrative logic for login, the information in this case being the password for a given username. These logical computations will be available in the \texttt{Admin} class, alongside functionality to fetch all active games stored in the database. We made this functionality because we want to avoid asking all active Game Threads to respond to a client request looking for all active games. This would be bad design considering our desire to make a scalable framework, as many users could requests to see the list of active games at the same time.
