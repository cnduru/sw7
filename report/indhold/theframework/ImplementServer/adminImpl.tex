\subsection{Implementation of Admin}
\label{sec:adminimpl}
The Admin class handles requests from the client that can be classified as not game specific. 

The \textit{VerifiyAccount} handles login-requests from the client.

The \textit{CreateGame} handles requests to start a new game.

The \textit{CloseGame} call has been implement by changing the visibility of the game, hereby not removing it but making it not appear when searching for the game.
