\subsubsection{Admin}
\label{sec:adminimpl}
The Admin class handles requests from the client that can be classified as not game specific. These are requests for something like:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{VerifiyAccount} handles login-requests from the client.
\item \textit{CreateGame} handles requests to start a new game
\end{itemize}
