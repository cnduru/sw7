\section{Client Design}\label{sec:desClient}
Given the time restriction for the project, the client has been designed with some limiting goals in mind. First of all it had to demonstrate the server functionality, using as much as the available interface as possible. This means that the actual implementation has been focused on the management of games rather than trying to provide a fun game experience. Additionally, the application has been designed as slim as possible, meaning that both that functionality comes first and that anything the server can handle, it should.
