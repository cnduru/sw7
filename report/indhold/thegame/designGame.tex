\section{Game scenario}\label{sec:game}
This section describes the game we have decided to focus on. This game will be implemented as a prototype for proof of concept. It implements different uses of the server functionality that we want to display. It was also created for the purpose of setting a limitation for the server functionality. Otherwise we could have kept creating functionality for multiple different purposes. The game we have decided to create a scenario for, is a game based on the real-life coordinates of the participants. The game should be playable among friends, and be interactive. The game is a prototype that could be implemented on top of our server and item balance, e.g. a certain weapon may be stronger than intended, is in no way to be considered final in the game.

The biggest advantage of creating a specific game scenario is a better insight into the general functionality needed on the server side. It furthermore provides a goal which helps with motivation and work culture, in the sense that we could more easily divide the work needed in the project. One of the drawbacks of using a scenario in this way is that, if one is not not careful, it could cause us to accidentally focus strictly on the scenario, and might exclude functionality that could be useful on the server side. Just because the functionality does not fit a certain scenario does not mean it is not useful for a general model. Furthermore, we might not get the flexibility we look for in a server as we don't have different types of games to test it with.

\subsection{Game Rules}\label{subsec:game-rules}

The following is a description of the game scenario.

\paragraph{Game winning criteria}
The idea is for one of the competing teams to obtain an ultimate relic. Once a team locates it, the game should end with a victory for the team with the relic. At the start of the game it is impossible to know where the relic is located, and you gradually locate it by finding clues around the map.
Another way to win is to be the team with the largest amount of points if a time limit is set and reached.
